# CodeIgniter Base Setup

This is a CodeIgniter install with some added features:
- Static laravel like routing
- UhOh! errors
- and a couple of my custom helper files

## Static Laravel like routing

This is a routing system similar to laravel. It has awesome features like:
- Create routes based on the HTTP verb request, helping to create a RESTful web service.
- Create named routes.
- and many others

The routing library is from [this repo](https://github.com/Patroklo/codeigniter-static-laravel-routes) by Joseba Ju√°niz ([@Patroklo](http://twitter.com/Patroklo))
